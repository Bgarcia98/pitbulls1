            <h1>Causes of Over Population in Shelters </h1>
            <p> The cause for this is over breeding of pitbulls and strict Breed-Specific Legislation laws (BSL). BSL laws have put pitbulls as one of the most banned or regulated "breed" of dogs even though pitbulls aren't even a breed. Pitbulls are a colection of different dog breeds under the bully catagory or mixed breeds in those effects. This makes it hard for people to adopt pitbulls because it can be considered illegal to own, sell, breed, or transport pitbulls without proper documentation or proof that the dog is not dangerous. The other cause is irresonsible breeding of pitbulls. Pitbull females can have large litters from 6-12 puppies in each. So not having a pitbull nuetered, like for any other dog, causes for over population of them on the street and in shelters.</p>
